Look at the histogram of each variables
```{r}

```


```{r}
# compute a correlation matrix

cor_matrix

# graph a heatmap based on the correlation matrix
corrplot(cor_matrix, method="color", tl.cex=0.8)

```


Look at the correlation with quality
```{r}
quality_corr <- cor(num_wine)[, "quality"]
sort(quality_corr, decreasing = TRUE)

```


```{r}
# plot the distribution of each variable vs wine quality
ggplot(wine_long, aes(x = factor(quality), y = value)) +
